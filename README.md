# Apollo Coding Challenge
I designed this project solely for the purpose of completing the coding challenge sent to me. It provides a RESTful API to manage a collection of vehicle data, supporting Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. This project is designed to be easily extensible and deployable, ensuring a seamless developer experience.  The application also includes automation scripts to set up the environment, populate the database with sample data, and manage the project's lifecycle.
